# In the original representation of environments, this caused an exponential
# blowup in time and allocation. With that representation, this took about 20
# seconds on my laptop and had a max RSS of ~12 GB. Big enough to be really
# noticeable, but not so big it's likely to crash a developer machine. With the
# better environment representation, it runs almost instantly and has an RSS of
# ~90 MB.
