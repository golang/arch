# In the XED data, *all* floating point bitwise logic operation has their
# operand type marked as uint. We are not trying to understand why Intel
# decided that they want FP bit-wise logic operations, but this irregularity
# has to be dealed with in separate rules with some overwrites.

# Int/Uint operations.
# Non-masked for 128/256-bit vectors
# For binary operations, we constrain their two inputs and one output to the
# same Go type using a variable. This will map to instructions before AVX512.

# Looks like VPAND$xi works only for 2 shapes for integer:

# TODO: should we wildcard other smaller elemBits to VPANDQ or
# VPANDD? Looks like elemBits doesn't really matter afterall in bitwise operations.
